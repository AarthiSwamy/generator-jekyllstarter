### What is Jekyll Starter?

Jekyll Starter is a bootstrap project to get you started quickly on blogging with Jekyll. You can read more about Jekyll [here](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll Starter is based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), which is a specific style atop [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole). This starter project includes social integration using [AddThis](https://www.addthis.com) for sharing and author following across many social media platforms. Integration with Google Analytics is also built in, using [Google Analytics superProxy](https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/google-analytics-super-proxy).

The starter also provides tag visualization in each post, and as a consolidated tag based archive. A grunt based build is included, which currently supports css minification and merging - for faster loading of the blog.

You can find the [Jekyll Starter project](https://github.com/msanand/jekyllstarter) on github. Feel free to contribute with a pull request.

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-jekyllstarter from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jekyllstarter
```

Finally, initiate the generator:
